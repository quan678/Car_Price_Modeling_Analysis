# Car Market Analysis

## Overview
This project is dedicated to analyze the car market and predicts car values based on a variety of attributes such as make, model, year, and specifications. The approach includes comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights and predictive accuracy.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardize and clean the dataset to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Employ statistical and visualization tools to understand the dataâ€™s underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop and tune visualizations that reflects the correlation between car values and other factors based on the features identified during EDA.

## Tools Used
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Data Sources
This project utilizes a dataset containing information about various cars, including their specifications, sale prices, and other relevant attributes. The data was sourced from Kaggle, which aggregates car sales data across multiple regions.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
- `src/`: Python scripts for custom functions and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

## Challenges
- **Data Quality:** Handling missing values and erroneous entries in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Deciding which features are predictive and how to encode categorical variables.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the most effective model and tuning hyperparameters.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deployment:** Develop a web application to allow users to input car attributes and receive price predictions.
- **Data Enrichment:** Incorporate more granular data, such as geographic location and additional car features.
- **Algorithm Improvement:** Explore more complex models like XGBoost or neural networks for better accuracy.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Install dependencies as listed in the `requirements.txt`.
- Run the Jupyter notebook `Car_Price_Project.ipynb` to view the project's workflow and results.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide actionable insights into car price determinants and establish a reliable prediction system to aid buyers and sellers in the automotive industry. It also seeks to continuously evolve by integrating new data and improving prediction methodologies.
